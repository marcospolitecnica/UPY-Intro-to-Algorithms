## ** What is an Algorithm? ** ##

An Algorithm is a set of rules that a program must follow to achieve a result.
Is a recipe of how to get a desirable computational outcome.
A well designed algorithm has the following characteristics:
- Is finite. It cannot run forever, must have a starting and ending points.
- Must have well-dfined inputs and outputs.
- Must be computationally factible. It must not use all available resources, it must be efficient.
- Given certain inputs, must produce the same output every single time it is run.

### Example of an algorithm in everyday life ###

Brush my teeth
  1. Go to bathroom
  2. Take the toothpaste
  3. Open the toothpaste
  4. Take the brush
  5. Put paste along the brush without pouring it off the brush
  6. Put the cap back on the toothpaste
  7. Take a glass
  8. Fill the glass up with water
  9. If mouth has residual food debris, rinse with water
      If not, skip to step 10
  10. Brush teeth.
      Does it feel clean and fresh? If so, go to step 11.
      If not, repeat step 10.
  11. Rinse mouth with water
      If toothpaste is completely removed, go to step 12
      If not, rinse more.
  12. Clean brush with enough water.
  13. Done!
