### Data Engineering 1-B

| Topic | Knowledge | Know how |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Fundamental concepts	| Define concepts and characteristics of algorithms	| Pose algorithms of everyday situations
| Algorithm representation	|Differentiate control structures in the design and construction of an algorithm:
- Selective structures
- Repetitive structures
- nested structures |

Describe the types of algorithm representation:
- Graph: Flow chart
- Written: pseudocode ** 	Represent algorithmic structures in the form of pseudocode and flowchart.|
